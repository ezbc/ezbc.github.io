I adopted this recipe from
[here](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-ginger-kombucha-drink-recipes-from-the-kitchn-206552)
which has led to at least a dozen successful batches. The plain kombucha will
take about 2 weeks to complete at room temperature.

# Plain Kombucha

**Makes 1 gallon**

## Ingredients

+ 3 1/2 quarts water
+ 1 cup white sugar
+ 4 bags black tea (or 1 tablespoons loose tea)
+ 4 bags green or herbal tea (or 1 tablespoon loose tea)
+ 2 cups pre-made unflavored kombucha (from your last homemade batch or store-bought)
+ 1 scoby

## Steps

1. Bring the water to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the sugar to
   dissolve. Steep tea until the water has cooled.

2. Once the tea is cool, remove the tea bags. Stir in the pre-made kombucha. 

3. Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon glass jar and gently slide the scoby on top
   with clean hands. Cover the mouth of the jar with a few layers of
   cheesecloth or paper towels secured with a rubber band.

4. Keep the fermenting kombucha at room temperature, out of direct sunlight,
   and where it won't get jostled. Ferment for 7 to 10 days, or until taste is
   desired.

5. Remove the scoby. Measure out your starter tea from this batch of kombucha to
   be added to the next batch.

7. Stir kombucha to distribute leftover scoby fragments. Add the kombucha to
   bottles.  Leave about an inch of head room in each bottle. Store the bottled
   kombucha at room-temperature out of direct sunlight and allow 1 to 3 days for
   the kombucha to carbonate.

8. Refrigerate once carbonated.
