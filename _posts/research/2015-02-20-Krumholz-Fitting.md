## Summary of Sternberg et al. (2014)

The main predictor of \\( \Sigma_{HI} \\) and $$\Sigma_{\rm H2}$$ is the ratio
of the free space FUV field intensity to the gas density, i.e. dissociation
rate / $H_2$ formation rate. Next predictors are metallicity and dust-to-gas
mass ratio. 

\\[ \Sigma_{test} \\]

##### Breakdown:

1. Normalize UV radiation field with $H_2$ dissociation rate. Define
   derivative of dissociation bandwidth as the $H_2$ self-shielding function.

2. Define FUV opacity of dust grains and $H_2$ formation rate on dust.
   Dust-to-gass mass ratio scales linearly with metallicity.

3. Define differentiable EQ of depth-dependent steady-state $HI / H_2$
   formation/destruction. $H_2$-dust-limited dissociated bandwidth defined.

4. Integrate diff EQ to get HI column density.
