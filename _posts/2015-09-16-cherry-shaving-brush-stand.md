title: Shaving Brush Stand
---

## The Stand

My shaving brush was not drying entirely between uses; the solution: hang it
upside down. I recycled some scrap cherry and maple in the burn pile to make a
modern stand about 5 inches tall to hold my shaving brush upside down. The
stand took a couple of hours to construct.
