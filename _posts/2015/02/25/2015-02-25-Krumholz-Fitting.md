Jouni Kainulainen shared 2MASS Av image with us today. He provided the
following warning:

Attached is a near-IR-derived visual extinction map (A_V) that more-or-less
stitches together the maps of California, Taurus, and Perseus from Kainulainen
et al. (2009). It is not quite a perfect coverage, but you can have a look and
decide if it is adequate.

I did not quite get the full picture of what you are planning to do… But in any
case, I think I should emphasise that maps such as these are derived by
comparing stellar colours to some reference field. In other words, the maps
measure the relative extinction compared to that reference field, not absolute
extinction (this is, to my knowledge, true for all near-IR maps out there).

Since this kind of large maps span several degrees on the sky, the reference
field colours are likely to change within the map. Therefore, I have used
several reference fields and interpolated between them to compute the
"zero-point" of the extinction in the map. 

Whether the above affects your analysis or not, I don't now, but I think it is
an important point to remember when considering the ability of the map to trace
various gas components.

Below is a screenshot of the Av image with the Planck Av 4 and 8 mag contours.
