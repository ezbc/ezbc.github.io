## Yeast Starter

Instructions originally from
[here](http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter6-5.html).

Below are the steps I have adopted for a yeast starter.

1. Boil a pint (1/2 quart) of water and stir in 1/2 cup (80 g) of Dextrified
   Malt Extract. Boil to sanitize.

2. Place pot of DME water in cool waterbath.

2. Fill a 1/2 gallon ball jar with sanitizing liquid. Shake with top loose to
   sanitize lid.

3. Sanitize the yeast packet and scissors.

4. Poor out sanitizer from jar. Add yeast and DME water.

5. Screw lid loosely, so CO$$_2$$ can escape, but air does not enter.

6. Store in a 70 - 80 $$^\circ$$ F area. Disturb the yeast periodically by
   sloshing the liquid to feed it.

7. Allow 12 - 48 hours for the yeast to multiply.
