title: No-Knead Bread Recipe

This sourdough recipe will yield artisan loafs without any kneading. I have
combined a no-knead bread technique from the [Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a
Day](http://www.amazon.com/Artisan-Bread-Five-Minutes-Revolutionizes/dp/0312362919)
by Jeff HertzBerg and Zoe Francois with the ingredients and techniques from a
[Wild Yeast Blog](http://www.wildyeastblog.com/my-new-favorite-sourdough/) post
on Norwich Sourdough.  The Norwich Sourdough inclusion of rye flour gives the
loaves an extra bite complimentary to the tangy sourdough, all without ever
needing to touch the dough. The hands-on time spent actually paying attention to
these loaves is minimal making this recipe a low commitment, but yields
delicious results.

   Flip dough out of bowl into Dutch Oven. Cut slashes across top. Put lid on
