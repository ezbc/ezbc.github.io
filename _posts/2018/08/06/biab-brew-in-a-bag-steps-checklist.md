How to brew in a bag

<!--more-->

Brewing Checklist

1. Setup vessel.
1. Add rice hulls to grains
1. Put grains in bag 
1. Add grains and water to vessel. Disturb grains in water to soak grains fully.

1. (optional) Perform acid rest

1. Correct pH to achieve 5.4 pH. 

1. Finish mashing.
1. When done mashing, set to boil mode
1. Set power to 100
1. When boil reached, add defoamer.

1. Measure gravity. Compare to the target original gravity. If the measured
   gravity is too low, boil the wort until the measured gravity reaches the
   target original gravity.

1. Set power to 55

1. Add bittering hops to hop basket. Continue the boil according to the recipe.

1. 15 minutes from end of boil, add Irish moss powder

1. Make sanitizing solution.

1. Sanitize the plate chiller, primary fermenter, airlock and gravity reader.

1. When boil complete, add aroma hops to hop bag.

1. Switch connections for chilling. Chill the wort.

1. Pitch yeast into primary fermenter.

1. Pump wort into primary fermenter.

1. Record the gravity of the wort.

1. Clean up! Backflush the chiller.



## Correcting pH

Every public tap water source I have used to this date has been too basic and
required an addition of acid.

Measure the pH with an electronic pH reader. Add 1 mL of lactic acid at 88%
concentration. Stir and disturb the grains to distribute the acid throughout
the wort. Measure the pH again. Repeat this process until the pH reaches 5.4.
