# Overview

# Activity

## Supplies

1. 50 sheets of 8 1/2" x 11" paper per team.

1. Whiteboard or flipchart for keeping score.

## Goal

Earn as many points as possible by building and throwing paper airplanes. A team
receives points by making accurate estimates of the number of planes the team
will build and by building successful planes. Teams lose points for incomplete
or defective planes.

## Instructions for Teams

1. Design planes, plan construction, and plan QA with your team in planning
   phase.

1. Build as many planes as you can in build and test phase.

1. Planes must have wings.

1. A plane must fly 20 feet to be successful.

1. Estimate the number of successful planes your team will build during the
   iteration. Your team receives points equal to the number of failed planes and
   unfinished (work-in-progress) planes subtracted from the estimated number of
   successful planes.
